# Rexx: A multipurpose discord bot

This is an old project of mine I started working on back in 2020. It was my the first bigger project I made. It was discontinued when Discord announced they were forcing all developers to switch to slash commands, and I was too lazy to rewrite my entire code base as it was quite a lot.
